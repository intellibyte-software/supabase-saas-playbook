# Supabase SaaS Playbook

> A domain-agnostic blueprint for building production-ready SaaS applications with Supabase, Vercel, and React. Supports multi-tenant and single-tenant architectures.

This repository contains documentation, templates, and AI agent skills for scaffolding new Supabase-based SaaS projects.

## Core Documents

- [AI Agent Playbook](ai-agent-playbook.md): 16-phase step-by-step guide to scaffold a new project from scratch. Covers monorepo setup, Supabase config, edge functions, AI pipeline, CI/CD, observability, and more.
- [Architecture](architecture.md): Technical architecture reference covering data models (multi-tenant and single-tenant), AI detection pipeline, frontend patterns, database design, CI/CD, and observability with New Relic.
- [Executive Summary](executive-summary.md): Non-technical overview of system capabilities, technology choices, and deployment model.

## Templates (copy into new projects)

- [templates/CLAUDE.md](templates/CLAUDE.md): Claude Code agent instructions — local stack setup, migrations, baselining, E2E tests, AI analysis architecture, code quality rules.
- [templates/AGENTS.md](templates/AGENTS.md): GitHub Copilot / AI agent instructions — project structure, dev commands, testing, migration workflow.
- [templates/ci.yml](templates/ci.yml): GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow — validate, Supabase deploy, Vercel production deploy with Nx affected detection.
